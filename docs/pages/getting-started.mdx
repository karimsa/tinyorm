# Getting Started

To get started, you must add tinyorm and its peer dependencies to your project.

## Installation

TinyORM can be installed from the npm registry using any package manager.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm install --exact @karimsa/tinyorm pg@8 zod@3
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add --exact @karimsa/tinyorm pg@8 zod@3
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting up your tsconfig / builds

There's a few modifications that need to be made to your project's `tsconfig.json` to use TinyORM:

### `target`

You must target ES2015 or higher to use TinyORM.

**Recommendation:** Set your target to `esnext`, and use a modern transpiler like `babel` or `esbuild`.

**Workaround:** Set your target to something above `ES2015`.

TODO: This is not going to work well for people using `tsc` to do their module transpilation.

### `!` / `strictPropertyInitialization`

To decorate entity class columns, you have two options for your project setup that will allow you to
write classes with uninitialized properties. By default, in strict mode, TS will complain about classes
that specify properties without initializing them. This is sensible behavior, but TinyORM's column decorators
need the empty property definitions to generate migrations.

**Recommendation:** Use the `!` operator when defining your columns. For example:

```ts
import { Column } from '@karimsa/tinyorm';

class User {
  @Column()
  id!: number;

  @Column()
  name!: string;
}
```

This allows you to use TS in strict mode, and still use TinyORM.

**Workaround:** Set `strictPropertyInitialization` to false in your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictPropertyInitialization": false
  }
}
```

And then you can write your columns without using the `!` operator:

```ts
import { Column } from '@karimsa/tinyorm';

class User {
  @Column()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;
}
```

### `experimentalDecorators`

To use TinyORM's decorators, you must set `experimentalDecorators` to true.

If you are using babel, you have to enable legacy decorators using the plugin `@babel/plugin-syntax-decorators` and
setting the `legacy` option to true.
