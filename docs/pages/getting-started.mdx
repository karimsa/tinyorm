# Getting Started

To get started, you must add tinyorm and its peer dependencies to your project.

## Installation

TinyORM can be installed from the npm registry using any package manager.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm install --exact @karimsa/tinyorm pg@8 zod@3
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn add --exact @karimsa/tinyorm pg@8 zod@3
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting up your tsconfig / builds

There's a few modifications that need to be made to your project's `tsconfig.json` to use TinyORM:

### `target`

You must target ES2015 or higher to use TinyORM.

**Recommendation:** Set your target to `esnext`, and use a modern transpiler like `babel` or `esbuild`.

**Workaround:** Set your target to something above `ES2015`.

TODO: This is not going to work well for people using `tsc` to do their module transpilation.

### `strictPropertyInitialization`

To write entity classes, you will need to set `strictPropertyInitialization` to false in your `tsconfig.json`.
This stops `tsc` from complaining about class properties that are compile-time only.

### `experimentalDecorators`

To use TinyORM's decorators, you must set `experimentalDecorators` to true.

If you are using babel, you have to enable legacy decorators using the plugin `@babel/plugin-syntax-decorators` and
setting the `legacy` option to true.
