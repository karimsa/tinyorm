# Custom SQL Queries

You can use [sql](/reference/sql) to build custom SQL queries, and [Connection.query](/reference/connection#query-method) to execute them.

```ts
import { createConnectionPool, sql } from '@karimsa/tinyorm'

const pool = await createConnectionPool()

const results = await pool.withConnection(async connection => {
    return connection.query(sql`
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${1}
    `)
})
```
