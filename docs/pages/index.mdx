# Introduction

TinyORM is designed as an incredibly minimal ORM for Postgres & TypeScript.

## Features

 * **Extremely minimal**: TinyORM supports a subset of what other ORMs support, to keep things simple
 and only include incredibly useful features.
 * **Opt-in migrations, with auto-migrations for development.** Select the migrations individually,
 and don't feel the pain of auto-migration.
 * **Customizable**: Switch into raw SQL whenever you need to so you can always customize however you'd
 like.
